The Code is Published with and without the prebuilt binaries, and are attempted to be complete or nearly complete Applications, and thus serve as valuable freeware for the community.

Mini-Fractals OpenCL is covered under CPOL and otherwise by Creative Commons License. The USe of the Orbital Function Z <-- sin(Z) / C where Z0 = 1/C (i think, or is it just Z0 = C ???) ... anyway, my culture for this project is to use the same or nearly same area, using e-Smoothing Coloring (optional?), and having each branch of the code use different color schemes.
I hope this idea catches on. Thank You.
